Usability guidelines
--------------------

One item per page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As it turns out that people tend to be challenged when being prompted with more than one question at once, mobile4D implements a "one question per page" concept. Next page, next question. Always be transparent on how many pages are still to come, though.

Avoid typing
^^^^^^^^^^^^
A design concept of mobile4D

Text-free (or sparse-text) interfaces are targeted for the mobile client in the first place, not really the administrative website.

**Implementation:** Text-free interfaces have not really been investigated and implemented besides the usual examples. mobile4D is everything but text-free.


Avoid numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Numbers, if crowdsourced, are rarely correct, and rather estimates. mobile4D tries to avoid people to have to give exact number, but rather used text-free interfaces, as the flood-height picker.





Transparency on data quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Chose the right input at the right time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
